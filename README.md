# Exam-portal

The Exam Portal project is a web-based application designed to recruit 2nd-year students in the college technical society using various technologies such as NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, Nodemailer, Mongoose, and Cyclic. The primary goal of this project is to provide an efficient platform for the selection process of the technical society.

To ensure the efficiency of the portal, we have designed separate admin and user sides. The admin side provides access to the administrators of the portal, who can create new exams, manage users, and view the results of the exams. On the other hand, the user side is accessible to the candidates who are interested in joining the technical society. They can create their profiles, enroll in exams, and view their results.

The portal is built on NodeJS and ExpressJS, which provides a fast and efficient server-side framework. It is integrated with MongoDB, a NoSQL database, which enables the efficient storage and retrieval of data. Nodemailer is used to send emails to the candidates after they enroll in exams, providing them with important information about the exams.

To ensure the smooth functioning of the portal, we have used Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution for modeling application data and works seamlessly with NodeJS and MongoDB.

Overall, the Exam Portal project is a comprehensive and efficient solution for the selection process of the technical society. The use of various technologies such as NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, Nodemailer, Mongoose, and Cyclic makes it a robust and scalable platform that can handle a large number of users and exams.
